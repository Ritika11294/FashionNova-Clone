## FashionNova (Clone)
It's an e-commerce website where you can buy any attire for both males and females. This was a team project. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned in Unit-2 in Masai School, we were able to clone the front end with similar looks and features.



## Technologies we used
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
Along with that, in order to store user data and product data we also used LocalStorage.
